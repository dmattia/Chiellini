How To Play
This is a variant of the traditional Pacman game called Chiellini.  In this
game, the ghosts of Luis Suarez attempt to find you and bite you.  Your only
chance at survival is finding the red cards in the corners.

Use the arrow keys to move around. Your goal is to avoid being bitten while
visiting the entire field.  Spots not yet visited are marked with dots.

You have three lives.  When you die, you lose one life and all ghost positions
are reset as well as your position.  Be warned that mashing buttons upon death
can cause considerable lag in your next life.
